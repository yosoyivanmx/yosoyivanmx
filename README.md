Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm new at GitHub, I'm from Mexico and have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and learning the software development process, including research, planning, coding, testing and all my teachers consider could be useful. 

I used to work at the airline industry and Mexican Payroll, therefore, I've started to think and work in some ideas to speed the payroll processes.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Ruby by myself, since Java is the first and the main we use at university, at least for now.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever I can, but I think that for now, in my first steps I might not be much helpful.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning the logic when I'm stuck and unable to complete a code, I think that's the most difficult thing: programming logic.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... I don't think I can help much right now, but if possible I'd help about logic.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: giaj12@hotmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not funny :(
